# How to test code 

Install the `tox` package by running 
```bash
pip install tox
```
in the command prompt.

Go into the src folder and type "tox".

You will need to have `tox` installed and `tox.ini` file may need to point to 
binaries of Python you wish to use in the test.  Note that tox does NOT work
with Anaconda version of Python at this point (Dec 2016).
