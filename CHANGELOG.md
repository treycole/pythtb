------

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Fixed `AttributeError` in `TBModel.visualize_3d()` and `Lattice.visualize_3d()` on Matplotlib >= 3.9, which removed `matplotlib.cm.get_cmap()`

## [2.0.2] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- Fixed `TBModel.nn_bonds` return type to match documentation (#98)
- Fixed spin projection in `TBModel.plot_bands()`
- Removed `W90.model` parameter `fill_hermitian` which unintentionally double-counted hopping parameters

### Improved
- Significant speedup in `TBModel.hamiltonian()` and `TBModel.velocity()` via factored phase computation
- Faster `W90` model initialization

### Changed
- Updated `TBModel.set_hop()` docstring convention to match `TBModel.hamiltonian()` ($H_{ij}$ instead of $t_{ij}$)
- Updated Berry phase tutorial to accurately reflect mesh endpoints and Berry flux trimming

## [2.0.1] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- Fixed bug in `Wannier.project` where the projection procedure improperly reshaped spinful wavefunctions leading to an error when projecting onto trial orbitals.
- Fixed bug in `models.ssh` where the intercell hopping was not set between neighboring unit cells as intended.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-11-11

### Fixed
- Fixed bug in `TBModel._shift_to_home()` where only the last orbital was shifted. This affected the `to_home` flag in `change_nonperiodic_vector()` and `make_supercell()`.

### Improved
- Vectorized code throughout using NumPy for substantial speed improvements
  - `TBModel` initialization, Hamiltonian construction, and diagonalization orders of magnitude faster for large models

- Modernized Sphinx-based documentation website, copying over the previous tutorials, and adding some new ones to cover new features
- `TBModel.visualize()`: Enhanced 2D Visualization

### Changed

These will be removed in a future release.

### Removed 

- Following [SPEC-0](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/) (Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination)
  - Dropped support for Python < 3.12 
  - Dropped support for NumPy < 2.0
  - Dropped support for Matplotlib < 3.9

**Expired deprecations**

- Removed parameter `to_home_supress_warning` in `TBModel.change_nonperiodic_vector()` and `TBModel.make_supercell()` (deprecated since v1.8.0). Default behavior is to only shift orbitals along periodic directions, with a warning sent to the logger if an orbital is outside the home unit cell in a non-periodic direction.

The following functionality has been removed. Users should update their code accordingly.

- Removed `TBModel.reduce_dim()`. This was used fix a particular k-component. `TBModel` is not intended to handle such constraints directly. This should be handled externally. 
- Removed `TBModel.ignore_position_operator_offdiagonal()`. Functionality replaced by `TBModel.assume_position_operator_diagonal` attribute setter. 
- Removed flag `individual_phases` in `WFArray.berry_flux()`. The returned Berry fluxes are always computed with individual phases now.

  which are not Bloch-like eigenstates.
