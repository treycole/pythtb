# # Boron-nitride ribbon
# 
# This boron-nitride ribbon calculation illustrates a case where it is a good idea to change a nonperiodic lattice vector to be
# normal to the periodic direction(s).  While the model is physically the same before and after the change, as shown by the
# identical band structures, the Berry phase is consistent with the polarization in the extended direction only after the change.

# ## Bands and Berry phase
#   
# Solve both models, showing that the band structures are the same, but Berry phases are different.
# 
# We will utilize the `Mesh` to store the k-points, and then solve the model on this mesh using the `WFArray` class and its method
# `solve_k_mesh`.
# 
# :::{note}
# The `solve_k_mesh` method will automatically impose periodic boundary conditions on the wave functions when it detects a periodicity in the k-space mesh. To suppress this behavior, you can set the `auto_detect_pbc` argument to `False`.
# :::
# 
# To compute the Berry phase, we use `WFArray.berry_phase`, passing the band indices and the mesh axis corresponding to direction we compute the Berry phase.

# ## Notes
# 
# :::{note}
# 
# Let $x$ be along the extended direction and $y$ be normal to it.
# 
# This model has an $M_x$ mirror symmetry, so the Berry phase is
# expected to be $0$ or $\pi$. We find it to be zero, but only after the
# 'change_nonperiodic_vector' method is used to force the nonperiodic
# "lattice vector" to be perpedicular to the extended direction.
# 
# The physical meaning of the Berry phase in the original model
# calculation is rather subtle. It is related to the position of
# the joint Wannier center (i.e., summed over occupied bands) in
# the direction of reciprocal lattice vector 0, which has a
# $y$ component as well as an $x$ component (since it must be normal
# to real space lattice vector 1). The joint Wannier center gets
# displaced along $y$ as the hopping $t$ is changed, so the Berry
# phase calculation gets "contaminated" by this displacement.
