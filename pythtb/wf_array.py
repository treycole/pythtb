class WFArray:
    r"""

    This class is used to store and manipulate an array of
    wavefunctions of a tight-binding model
    :class:`pythtb.TBModel` on a regular or non-regular grid
    These are typically the Bloch energy eigenstates of the
    model, but this class can also be used to store a subset
    of Bloch bands, a set of hybrid Wannier functions for a
    ribbon or slab, or any other set of wavefunctions that
    are expressed in terms of the underlying basis orbitals.
    It provides methods that can be used to calculate Berry
    phases, Berry curvatures, 1st Chern numbers, etc.

    *Regular k-space grid*:
    If the grid is a regular k-mesh (no parametric dimensions),
    a single call to the function
    :func:`pythtb.WFArray.solve_on_grid` will both construct a
    k-mesh that uniformly covers the Brillouin zone, and populate
    it with wavefunctions (eigenvectors) computed on this grid.
    The last point in each k-dimension is set so that it represents
    the same Bloch function as the first one (this involves the
    insertion of some orbital-position-dependent phase factors).

    Example :ref:`haldane_bp-example` shows how to use WFArray on
    a regular grid of points in k-space. Examples :ref:`cone-example`
    and :ref:`3site_cycle-example` show how to use non-regular grid of
    points.

    *Parametric or irregular k-space grid grid*:
    An irregular grid of points, or a grid that includes also
    one or more parametric dimensions, can be populated manually
    with the help of the *[]* operator.  For example, to copy
    eigenvectors *evec* into coordinate (2,3) in the *WFArray*
    object *wf* one can simply do::

      wf[2,3]=evec

    The wavefunctions (here the eigenvectors) *evec* above
    are expected to be in the format *evec[state,orbital]*
    (or *evec[state,orbital,spin]* for the spinfull calculation),
    where *state* typically runs over all bands.
    This is the same format as returned by
    :func:`pythtb.TBModel.solve_one` or
    :func:`pythtb.TBModel.solve_all` (in the latter case one
    needs to restrict it to a single k-point as *evec[:,kpt,:]*
    if the model has *dim_k>=1*).

    If WFArray is used for closed paths, either in a
    reciprocal-space or parametric direction, then one needs to
    include both the starting and ending eigenfunctions even though
    they are physically equivalent.  If the array dimension in
    question is a k-vector direction and the path traverses the
    Brillouin zone in a primitive reciprocal-lattice direction,
    :func:`pythtb.WFArray.impose_pbc` can be used to associate
    the starting and ending points with each other; if it is a
    non-winding loop in k-space or a loop in parameter space,
    then :func:`pythtb.WFArray.impose_loop` can be used instead.
    (These may not be necessary if only Berry fluxes are needed.)

    Example :ref:`3site_cycle-example` shows how one
    of the directions of *WFArray* object need not be a k-vector
    direction, but can instead be a Hamiltonian parameter :math:`\lambda`
    (see also discussion after equation 4.1 in :download:`notes on
    tight-binding formalism <misc/pythtb-formalism.pdf>`).

    The wavevectors stored in *WFArray* are typically Hamiltonian
    eigenstates (e.g., Bloch functions for k-space arrays),
    with the *state* index running over all bands.  However, a
    *WFArray* object can also be used for other purposes, such
    as to store only a restricted set of Bloch states (e.g.,
    just the occupied ones); a set of modified Bloch states
    (e.g., premultiplied by a position, velocity, or Hamiltonian
    operator); or for hybrid Wannier functions (i.e., eigenstates
    of a position operator in a nonperiodic direction).  For an
    example of this kind, see :ref:`cubic_slab_hwf`.

    :param model: Object of type :class:`pythtb.TBModel` representing
      tight-binding model associated with this array of eigenvectors.

    :param mesh_size: List of dimensions of the mesh of the *WFArray*,
      in order of reciprocal-space and/or parametric directions.

    :param nstates: Optional parameter specifying the number of states
      packed into the *WFArray* at each point on the mesh.  Defaults
      to all states (i.e., norb*nspin).

    Example usage::

      # Construct WFArray capable of storing an 11x21 array of
      # wavefunctions
      wf = WFArray(tb, [11, 21])
      # populate this WFArray with regular grid of points in
      # Brillouin zone
      wf.solve_on_grid([0.0, 0.0])

      # Compute set of eigenvectors at one k-point
      (eval, evec) = tb.solve_one([kx, ky], eig_vectors = True)
      # Store it manually into a specified location in the array
      wf[3,4] = evec
      # To access the eigenvectors from the same position
      print(wf[3,4])

        the code.

        The eigenfunctions :math:`\Psi_{n {\bf k}}` are by convention
        chosen to obey a periodic gauge, i.e.,
        :math:`\Psi_{n,{\bf k+G}}=\Psi_{n {\bf k}}` not only up to a
        phase, but they are also equal in phase.  It follows that
        the cell-periodic Bloch functions are related by
        :math:`u_{n,{\bf k+G}}=e^{-i{\bf G}\cdot{\bf r}} u_{n {\bf k}}`.
        See :download:`notes on tight-binding formalism
        <misc/pythtb-formalism.pdf>` section 4.4 and equation 4.18 for
        more detail.  This routine sets the cell-periodic Bloch function

        to this formula, overwriting the previous value.

        one direction of the array. We are assuming that the k-point
        mesh increases by exactly one reciprocal lattice vector along
        this direction. This is currently **not** checked by the code;
        it is the responsibility of the user. Currently *WFArray*
        does not store the k-vectors on which the model was solved;
        it only stores the eigenvectors (wavefunctions).

        Computes the Berry phase along a given array direction
        and for a given set of states.  These are typically the
        occupied Bloch states, in which case *occ* should range
        over all occupied bands.  In this context, the occupied
        and unoccupied bands should be well separated in energy;
        it is the responsibility of the user to check that this
        is satisfied.  If *occ* is not specified or is specified
        as 'All', all states are selected. By default, the
        function returns the Berry phase traced over the
        specified set of bands, but optionally the individual
        phases of the eigenvalues of the global unitary rotation
        matrix (corresponding to "maximally localized Wannier
        centers" or "Wilson loop eigenvalues") can be requested
        (see parameter *berry_evals* for more details).

        For an array of size *N* in direction $dir$, the Berry phase
        is computed from the *N-1* inner products of neighboring
        eigenfunctions.  This corresponds to an "open-path Berry
        phase" if the first and last points have no special
        relation.  If they correspond to the same physical
        Hamiltonian, and have been properly aligned in phase using
        :func:`pythtb.WFArray.impose_pbc` or
        :func:`pythtb.WFArray.impose_loop`, then a closed-path
        Berry phase will be computed.

        For a one-dimensional WFArray (i.e., a single string), the
        computed Berry phases are always chosen to be between -pi and pi.
        For a higher dimensional WFArray, the Berry phase is computed
        for each one-dimensional string of points, and an array of
        Berry phases is returned. The Berry phase for the first string
        (with lowest index) is always constrained to be between -pi and
        pi. The range of the remaining phases depends on the value of
        the input parameter *contin*.

        The discretized formula used to compute Berry phase is described
        in Sec. 4.5 of :download:`notes on tight-binding formalism
        <misc/pythtb-formalism.pdf>`.

        :param occ: Optional array of indices of states to be included
          in the subsequent calculations, typically the indices of
          bands considered occupied.  Default is all bands.

        :param dir: Index of WFArray direction along which Berry phase is
          computed. This parameters needs not be specified for
          a one-dimensional WFArray.

        :param contin: Optional boolean parameter. If True then the
          branch choice of the Berry phase (which is indeterminate
          modulo 2*pi) is made so that neighboring strings (in the
          direction of increasing index value) have as close as
          possible phases. The phase of the first string (with lowest
          index) is always constrained to be between -pi and pi. If
          False, the Berry phase for every string is constrained to be
          between -pi and pi. The default value is True.

        :param berry_evals: Optional boolean parameter. If True then
          will compute and return the phases of the eigenvalues of the
          product of overlap matrices. (These numbers correspond also
          to hybrid Wannier function centers.) These phases are either
          forced to be between -pi and pi (if *contin* is *False*) or
          they are made to be continuous (if *contin* is True).

        :returns:
          * **pha** -- If *berry_evals* is False (default value) then
            returns the Berry phase for each string. For a
            one-dimensional WFArray this is just one number. For a
            higher-dimensional WFArray *pha* contains one phase for
            each one-dimensional string in the following format. For
            example, if *WFArray* contains k-points on mesh with
            indices [i,j,k] and if direction along which Berry phase
            is computed is *dir=1* then *pha* will be two dimensional
            array with indices [i,k], since Berry phase is computed
            along second direction. If *berry_evals* is True then for
            each string returns phases of all eigenvalues of the
            product of overlap matrices. In the convention used for
            previous example, *pha* in this case would have indices
            [i,k,n] where *n* refers to index of individual phase of
            the product matrix eigenvalue.

        Computes the Chern number for a *WFArray* in the specified plane.
        The Chern number is computed as the integral of the Berry flux
        over the specified plane, divided by 2 * pi.
        The plane is specified by a tuple of two indices, which correspond
        to the directions in the parameter mesh.

        :param plane: Tuple of two indices specifying the plane in which
            the Chern number is computed. The indices should be between 0
            and the number of mesh dimensions minus 1. If None, the
            Chern number is computed for the first two dimensions of the mesh.

        :param state_idx: Optional array of indices of states to be included
          in the Chern number calculation. If None, all states are included.

        :returns: The Chern number for the specified plane. If the WFArray
            is defined in a higher-dimensional space, the Chern number
            is computed for each 2D slice of the higher-dimensional space.
            The shape of the returned array is (nk3, ..., nkd) if the plane is (0, 1),
